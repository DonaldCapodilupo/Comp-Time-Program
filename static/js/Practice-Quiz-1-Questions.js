This ratio is a proactive parameter that identifies the health of the digester by measuring the acid and alkalinity content.  As the ratio drops, indicating an increase in the acid content, it can indicate the need to make process adjustments … reduce feed rate, improve mixing, stabilize digester temperature, increase digester alkalinity, or other factors.  Because of the large amount of alkalinity in the digester, providing a huge buffer for the available acids, pH is a poor indicator to use for process control.  If a condition exists that affects the health of the digester, pH will continue to test in the acceptable range when the digester will have already gone sour.  By the time the pH drops to indicate a problem, the digester will already be in an unacceptable condition.  This is why pH is the wrong parameter to use for process control of anaerobic digestion."

This condition indicates that denitrification is taking place in the sludge blanket within the secondary clarifier … the small nitrogen gas bubbles are the end result of the denitrification activity.

The corrective measure here is to force more denitrification in the aeration tanks so that fewer nitrates are in the mixed liquor entering the clarifier.

Because filaments have more surface area as compared to most floc-forming organisms, they can transfer oxygen into their cells better than the floc-formers when the D.O. is low.  However, unlike the filaments, the majority of the floc-formers can use nitrate as a source of oxygen.  So, when the D.O. is less than about 0.4 mg/L, the floc former will continue to grow, even if the D.O. gets to zero.  This low D.O. environment does not allow the filaments to continue growing and they begin to die off.  On the opposite spectrum, high D.O. will allow the filaments to grow rapidly; however, the floc formers also grow at a rapid rate … allowing the floc formers to remain dominant over the filaments.  A D.O. range of 0.4 to 0.8 mg/L will typically allow the filaments to become dominant over the floc formers, which will increase the lattice structure of the activated sludge resulting in sludge bulking in the secondary clarifiers."
